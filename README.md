Trigger Tower Testing Software and Firmware

graphDCU -- quick and dirty plotting software for the basic data that we receive from the
	    VFE DCU's and the LVRB DCU

glibTRferead -- rough software for communicating with the glib board that connects to
	        the Trigger Tower. Currently we just get data from the onboard DCUs.
